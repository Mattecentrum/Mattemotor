# Mattemotor (Math engine)

This is the interactive mathematics exercise engine that is used on [matteboken.se](http://matteboken.se/) and [webmatematik.dk](http://webmatematik.dk).

An example of exercise used there is here: [Skolår 8/Bråk/Bråktal](https://www.matteboken.se/lektioner/hogstadiet/skolar-8/brak/braktal/uppgifter#!/exercises/11057).

##  Creating your own exercises

If you want to create your own exercise a good way to start would be to read the excellent manual (Currently only in Swedish): [Create-Exercise](Create-Exercise.md)

There is also a [collection of samples](samples) that can be used as inspiration.

## Source code
This repository used to old the source code but since it has evalbed outside this repository we've decided to remove it for no. The old code is still avalible in [this branch](https://github.com/Mattecentrum/Mattemotor/tree/engine-2015).
